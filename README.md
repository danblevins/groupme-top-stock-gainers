## About this Project

This project sends the top 3 stock gainers of the day to a GroupMe chat on-demand.

## Inspiration

During the "reddit stock market craze" of early 2021, my friends were always talking about the stock market. I figured this would be a good way for my friends to immediately know who are the top 3 stock gainers of the day.
